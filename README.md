# Applied Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection on Equipment
**Workshop presented during AMLD2019 26.01.2019 in Lausanne**

Original description is available at [AMLD webpages](https://www.appliedmldays.org/workshops/applied-machine-learning-for-anomaly-detection-on-equipment). 

The introductory slides are available in the [slides](/slides) folder of this repository. 

## Setup 

To reproduce the virtual environment used for the workshop install
[pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and type:

```bash
pipenv install
```

Then you should be able to start a jupyter notebook and execute the notebook content.

### Note

We are currently not providing access to [Arundo Composer](https://docs.arundo.com/composer/overview)
therefore you won't be able to follow the second part of the tutorial and deploy models to
[Arundo Fabric](https://docs.arundo.com/fabric/overview).


## Data

The data used in this workshop was extracted from the [Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan) (dataset ID: "FD001").
